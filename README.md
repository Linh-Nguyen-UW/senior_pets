# EDA project looks at senior pet intakes and outcomes at the Austin Animal Center.

# Brief conclusions:
1) The majority of senior cats and dogs at the Austin Animal Center have a good outcome, i.e: either being returned to owner, adopted or transferred. 
2) The ones staying at the shelter at the time of the analysis have not been there for too long. 
3) However, there is evidence that it takes longer time for these senior animals to be adopted compared to younger animals at the shelter.
